    In my experience working with ${1:Person}, ${2:he}${3:she} ${4:always}${5:usually}${6:never} completes
    ${7:his}${8:her} assigned tasks. I would rate the quality of ${9:his}${10:her} work as
    a ${11:x}/5.  ${12:He}${13:She} ${14:always}${15:usually}${16:never} completes tasks on time. 
    The accuracy of ${17:his}${18:her} work is ${19:always}${20:usually}${21:never} on point. 
    I am ${22:always}${23:usually}${24:never} looking forward to work with this person again.
